Things like computers, TVs, game systems and a whole lot more use electricity even when they’re not on. That means they can always experience a surge or they can just overheat and cause a fire. <space> The continuous electricity that’s flowing into them provides them with a source for a fire as well. By unplugging these items when you’re not using them and, therefore, not paying attention to them, you can cut down on your chances of a fire.</h9></td>

A professional can make sure that your furnace is going to keep working the right way and that it’s not going to put you in any danger of fire. A broken furnace could be a huge danger to the safety of you and your home. Monitoring and maintenance stop the problems before they even show up.</h9>

You want to keep your hair and your clothes out of the way when you’re starting a fire in your fireplace. You want to keep the stack of papers away from your wax melter. You also want to make sure that you’re watching closely for anything that could turn into a problem. You don’t want a fire to pop up anywhere and that means watching heat sources and anything close to them.</h9>

					<h6><b>Avoid smoking at home</b></h6></td>
					 <td align="center"><h9 style="color: #FFFAF0">If you do smoke, it’s important to always do so in a well-ventilated area and to completely put out the cigarette before you throw it away. Cigarettes have a variety of additives and materials inside of them that can continue to burn even if you think that you’ve put them out. That flame can then ignite inside your trashcan or outside your home and cause a fire. If you make sure to smoke outside, watching out for stray ashes and you make sure to put the cigarette out entirely before throwing it away you can cut down on this risk.

Monitor the wall outlets in your home and pay attention to any that suddenly don’t work. It could be evidence of a problem behind the walls. Look for cords to your electric belongings that are frayed or damaged. These could be signs of problems as well and you don’t want to plug them into your electrical system if you know there’s a problem already.</h9>
